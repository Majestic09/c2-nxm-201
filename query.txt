1.Create an index on the user_id field in the sales collection to improve the performance of your queries.
-->db.sales.createIndex({user_id:1});

2.Use the $lookup operator in an aggregation pipeline to join the vendors and sales collections, and return a new documents that contains the name and city of each vendor, along with their sales. The output should look like this:
-->db.vendors.aggregate([
  {$lookup: {
    from: "sales",
      localField: "_id",
      foreignField: "user_id",
      as: "sales"
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 1,
      name: 1,
      city: 1,
      sales: {
        _id: 1,
        item: 1,
        profit: 1
      }
    }
  }
]);
